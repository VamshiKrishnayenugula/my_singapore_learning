"""Do you want to convert a color image into grayscale? Use 
Pythonâ€™s cv2 module.
First install cv2 using > pip install opencv-python<
Below we are converting a color book image to grayscale. You 
can replace that with your own image. You must know where 
the image is stored.
When you want to view an image using CV2, a window will 
open. The waitkey indicates how long we expect the display 
window to be open. If a key is pressed before the display time is 
over, the window will be destroyed or closed"""
